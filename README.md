# TreeLogger
This application allows users to keep an inventory of trees growing on a property. The user may choose to record a survey of multiple trees, or to add/edit individual trees, separate from a survey. Future surveys may be conducted on trees already inventoried by a user. Users may record various attributes such as a tree's species, height, diameter, foliar density, and any additional comments relating to general health, watering/fertilization schedules, animal nesting, etc. Trees may be given identifying names to help differentiate multiple trees of the same species.
